// This file contains the code that will be executed if you run your program from the terminal. You
// don't have to write anything in this file, but you may use it to debug your code. You can create
// instances of the provided models as the following:
//
//     let model          = createBoundedModel()
//     let unboundedModel = createUnboundedModel()
//
// Or you can create any instance of your own models to test your code.
//
// You **are** encouraged to write tests of your own!
// You may write as many tests as you want here, or even better in `CoverabilityLibTests.swift`.
// Observe how the two existing tests are implemented to write your own.
